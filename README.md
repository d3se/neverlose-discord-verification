# Discord Bot Verification using PHP APIs

This repository contains a Discord bot written in Python that verifies users using a PHP API. If you're relatively new to both Python and PHP, but not a complete beginner, this README will guide you through setting up and understanding the code.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python (3.7+)
- PHP
- A MySQL database (or a compatible database)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/discord-verification-bot.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install discord.py requests
   ```

3. Set up your Discord Bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and obtain a bot token. Replace `"YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"` in the `bot.py` file with your bot token.

4. Create a MySQL database and set up the tables using the provided SQL queries in `database.sql`.

5. Update the PHP files (`token_verify.php` and `token.php`) with your database credentials (`$host`, `$db`, `$user`, `$pass`) and adjust any other settings if needed.

6. Upload the PHP files to a web server or use a local server environment like XAMPP.

7. Start the bot:

   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

## Bot Commands

- `!verify <code>`: Verify a user using a verification code. Replace `<code>` with the verification code provided.

## Understanding the Code

- `bot.py` contains the Discord bot's code written in Python using the `discord.py` library. It listens for the `!verify` command and communicates with the PHP API to verify users.

- `token_verify.php` is the PHP script responsible for verifying user tokens and updating the database accordingly.

- `token.php` generates unique verification tokens for users.

## Important Notes

- Make sure to secure your PHP files and database credentials to prevent unauthorized access.

- This bot assumes you have a specific channel ID for verification. You can change this channel ID to match your server's requirements.

- The code provided here is a starting point and may need further customization and security improvements for a production environment.
